# Good-Review
Review site created as part of a University project alongside a Designer and Backend helper. I personally worked on the entire front and database architecture.
It is a basic showcase site for companies from Moldova of different categories, where users can review them, either by giving them stars or posting a comment and an image.
It is not fully finished and quite alot of features are missing but it was created in React for the front, Springboot for the back and MySQL/XAMPP for the database.

# Setup guide
First for the client as usual for a React app you must initialize the app with npm init and install all the modules using npm install. After that npm start should start the local server.

For the backend you must open the GoodReviewJWT folder in IntelliJ/Some other Java IDE and install all the packages then run.
The main folder contains the database in the form of the file "good_review.sql". This file must be imported into XAMPP and the server started.
